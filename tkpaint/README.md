# TKPaint

Paint app, this is just the program

install whatever you need from the requirments file with pip

run the paint.pyw, install some packages if the paint.pyw complain that some packages are not installed(like tk_tools, pipreqs doesn't detect this module)

To build, run the setup.py

Ya need the command line to run the setup.py and the pip, but no need the command line for the paint.pyw
